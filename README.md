# sagg.in

Personal website to facilitate minecraft/other community.

Sagg.in exists due to the lack of organization in discord and the need to present information in a clear matter.
It's written in Go gingonic becuase, of the speed of the webserver. It's supposed to run secondary to a game server.


### Goals

- [x] Setting routes
